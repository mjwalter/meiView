is a community-driven effort to create a commonly-accepted, digital, symbolic representation 
of music notation documents.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to display variant readings of a piece of music
encoded in MEI with the help of MEItoVexFlow.

The the purpose of this demonstration, it displays the first 48 measures of the choral work 
starting 'Rogamus te piissima virgo Maria...' by Henricus Isaac.

You can see the variants and chose which one to display in the musical text by clicking on the green dots!

On the right-hand side you can see the sources and the list of places where each source is 
different from the base text.
