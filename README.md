=======
Application displaying music encoded in MEI format. 

The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is a community-driven effort to create a 
commonly-accepted, digital, symbolic representation of music notation 
documents.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how to display variant 
readings of a musical piece encoded in MEI using MEI2VexFlow. meiView uses 
MEI2VexFlow in order to render MEI segments onto the screen.

Within the score there're green dots above each measure that contains an <app>
element. Click on the dot, to see which source contains what musical text. 
You can select the variant you'd like to see in the score by clicking on it.

On the right-hand side, you can see the list of sources. When you click 
on a source, it expands into a list to show a list of places where the 
selected source has any difference from the base text.
